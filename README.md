# Rubriq

Rubriq turns scanned handwritten exam papers into evidence-linked, teacher-controlled assessments and learning analytics.

## Features

- **Evidence-first grading:** keeps each original page beside its transcription, criterion decision, confidence signal, and quoted evidence.
- **Teacher authority:** lets teachers override marks or request an AI re-evaluation, then accept or reject the suggestion.
- **Complete assessment flow:** supports class rosters, rubric-based exams, PDF/image uploads, Google Drive imports, processing, review, and release.
- **Learning analytics:** calculates student, class, exam, question, criterion, and concept performance deterministically.
- **Role-separated access:** gives teachers an assessment workspace and students a portal containing only released results.

Planning documents remain available in [PRD.md](PRD.md) and [MVP.md](MVP.md). They describe product intent and may include capabilities that are not implemented. The `docs/` directory describes the current codebase and operational behavior; start with its [reading order](docs/README.md#reading-order).

## Getting Started

Rubriq uses Python 3.13, Node.js 22, SQLite for local development, and PostgreSQL in production.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:9MidhunPM/rubriq.git
cd rubriq
cp .env.example .env
python3 -m venv backend/.venv
backend/.venv/bin/pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
cd backend
.venv/bin/python -m app.migrate
cd ..
```

Run the API from `backend/`:

```bash
cd backend
.venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Run the web app in a second terminal from `frontend/`:

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Create the first local teacher through `POST /api/auth/bootstrap`, or configure demo accounts as described in the [local development guide](docs/guides/local-development.md). Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` before processing live papers.

## Common Commands

```bash
(cd backend && .venv/bin/python -m pytest)

The frontend build currently passes. Biome lint reports existing application-source findings; see [testing](docs/reference/testing.md) and [known gaps](docs/known-gaps.md).

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 16 and React 19 for the teacher and student interfaces
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and SQLAlchemy for the API and domain logic
- SQLite locally and PostgreSQL in production
- OpenAI structured outputs for perception, grading, review, import, and grounded teacher assistance
- Alembic for schema migrations

## Security

Never commit `.env`, API keys, access tokens, passwords, or student paper data. Browser authentication uses opaque server-side sessions and CSRF protection. Review [security and privacy](docs/operations/security.md) before exposing an environment publicly.
